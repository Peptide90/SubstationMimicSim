# Substation Mimic Sim

This project was started by Jordan Taylor (@TheElectricBrit) as an educational resource for creation high voltage single line mimic diagrams for use in teaching and media production.

You can access the live version online here:

Planned features include:

- [ ] Drag and Drop component library
- [ ] System for connecting components
- [ ] Component state changing by clicking
- [ ] Simple power flow simulation from source to load with respect to component state

Advanced planned features:

- [ ] Interlocking rules to have sequence of operation of switchgear
- [ ] Tagging to allow group operation of equipment
- [ ] Library of example mimics
- [ ] Automatic labelling of equipment (toggleable and schema selector e.g. BP109, IEC, etc)
- [ ] Better control panel UI/UX
- [ ] Control panel event log (SCADA like)
